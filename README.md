ðŸ§  Muse-S-EEG-prep
Modular Muse-S EEG Preprocessor â€“ Hackathon Project

ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Extract, clean, and visualize brainwave activity (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma) from Muse-S EEG recordings. The pipeline supports raw signal inspection, multi-stage filtering, frequency decomposition, annotation, and optional validation.
The pipeline empowers EEG researchers and developers with a streamlined, modular process for cleaning and analyzing Muse-S data. Transparent plots and customizable filters make it ideal for experimentation, research, and hackathons.

ðŸ“¥ Input
CSV exported from Mind Monitor containing:

Raw EEG: TP9, AF7, AF8, TP10

TimeStamp column

ðŸ“¤ Output
ðŸ”¹ Visualizations
Raw EEG â€“ 4 subplots (1 per channel)
Filtered EEG â€“ high-pass + notch + low-pass
Artifact Annotations â€“ MAD-based thresholding overlays
ICA Cleanup Preview â€“ before vs. after component rejection
Brainwave Decomposition â€“ band-filtered EEG per channel
Power Spectral Density (PSD) â€“ 0â€“50 Hz energy plots
Validation Plot (optional) â€“ original vs. filtered band power with correlation and MSE
