Muse-S-EEG-prep
Muse S EEG preprocessor â€“ Hackathon Project

ðŸ§  Muse-S EEG Brainwave Pipeline â€“ Full Processing Flow
ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal
Develop a modular tool to extract, clean, visualize, and optionally validate brainwave activity (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma) from Muse-S EEG recordings. Users benefit from raw signal inspection, layered filtering, frequency decomposition, and detailed visualization of power spectra and annotations.

ðŸ“¥ Input
CSV from Mind Monitor, containing:

Raw EEG (4 channels: TP9, AF7, AF8, TP10)

Timestamps

ðŸ“¤ Output
Plots

Raw EEG (4 subplots) â€“ unfiltered channel traces

Base-filtered EEG â€“ highpass + notch + lowpass

Annotated EEG with dynamic threshold artifacts

ICA removal preview â€“ original vs. ICA-cleaned

Brainwave decomposed signals â€“ per-channel Raw view with 5 frequency bands

Power Spectral Density (PSD) Plot â€“ full-spectrum analysis (0â€“50 Hz)

Validation plot (optional) â€“ compares original vs. filtered band power with correlation & MSE

CSV Export

Raw EEG & filtered EEG

Brainwave band values per channel (4 Ã— 5)

Global annotation metadata per timepoint

FIF Files

Saved filtered/decomposed Raw objects (.fif) for each channel

ðŸ§ª Pipeline Steps
Data Loading

Converts raw Muse CSV to an MNE-compatible Raw object

Handles missing data, centers channels, scales values to volts

Raw EEG Plot

Displays the original signal for each channel

Base Filtering

High-pass filter (default: 1 Hz)

Notch filter (default: 50 Hz)

Low-pass filter (default: 40 Hz)

EEG reference set to â€˜averageâ€™

Filtered EEG Plot

Shows cleaned signals after filtering

Dynamic Threshold Artifact Annotation

Annotates segments exceeding a multiple of the median absolute deviation (MAD)

Visualized as overlays on the EEG trace

Annotation Reset (Optional)

Removes specific annotations (e.g., "BAD_dynamic") for clean ICA input

ICA Decomposition & Cleanup

Fits ICA model to identify blink/heartbeat/muscle artifacts

Plots components, sources, and properties

Allows interactive or scripted rejection

Reconstructs signal and plots before vs. after

Brainwave Band Extraction

Extracts Deltaâ€“Gamma bands per channel

MNE Raw object is created for each channel with original + 5 bands

Per-Channel Band Plot

Time-domain visualization of each frequency-filtered band per channel

Power Spectral Density (PSD) Plot

Shows frequency energy distribution across all channels (0â€“50 Hz)

Data Export

Saves decomposed .fif files for each channel

Consolidated CSV output (timestamps, bands, annotations)
